# Infection

### ~avatar avatar

There is a disease outbreak! Will you find patient zero?!?

### ~

**Infection** is a distributed game which simulates 
the propagation of an illness. **The goal is to stop the outbreak before every player dies!**

* **Number of players:** 1 Master, 4 or more players. Each Master and players need a @boardname@ with battery pack.

In this game, a master @boardname@ infects a "patient zero" player
with the sickness. The infected player will be contagious immediately but won't show any sign 
during the incubation time. The sickness gets transmitted when two @boardname@ get close to each other.
After the incubation period, the sad face will appear on the screen. After the sickness period, the player will eventually die and a skull will display on the screen. Dead players are out of the game.

If any player survives the outbreak, the game is won. Otherwise try again!

### ~ hint

**Infection** is an engaging game that will get your students running around.
We recommend playing it outside to give more space for the students.

### How to play

Press `A+B` to enter master mode (1 per game).

Wait for players to be paired. The number of paired player will display on screen.
A letter will appear on the player's screen, this letter is the player's identity.

Once all your players are registered, press `A+B` to start the infection game. 
The game will pick a random player as **patient zero**.

A player will transmit the disease if close enough (`RSSI`) and with a certain probability (`TRANSMISSIONPROB`). 
During the incudation phase (`INCUBATION`), the player does not show any sign of illness (happy face). 
After that phase, the player gets sick and shows a sad face on the screen. After the sick face, the player dies and a skull shows up.

Once the game is over, the @boardname@ will show the player id (A,B,C...), health and 
who infected him. The master @boardname@ will show the identity of patient zero.
