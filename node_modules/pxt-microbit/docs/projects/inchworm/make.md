## Step 4: front teeth

Fold each corners on one end of the cardbard. This will be the front of the inchworm which is supposed to grip the ground.

## Step 5: back teeth

Using a scissor or a cutter (watch the fingers!), cut out various strips in the other edge. Fold one after the other.

## Step 10: attaching paper clip to cardboard

Slide the folder paper clip into the cardboard, and use tape to secure it. 
You might need to toy around with the size of the clip so that the servo rotation opens the inchworm sufficiently.
