# Button Is Pressed

Check whether a button is pressed right now. The @boardname@ has two buttons: button `A` and button `B`.

```sig
input.buttonIsPressed(Button.A);
```

### Parameters

* ``button`` is a [String](/types/string). You should store `A` in it to check the left button, `B` to check the right button, or `A+B` to check both at the same time.

### Returns

* [Boolean](/blocks/logic/boolean) that is `true` if the button you are checking is pressed, `false` if it is not pressed.

### Example

This program uses an [if](/blocks/logic/if) to run 
one part of the program if the `A` button is pressed, and 
another part if it is not pressed.

```blocks
basic.forever(() => {
    let pressed = input.buttonIsPressed(Button.A)
    if (pressed) {
        // this part runs if the A button is pressed
        basic.showNumber(1, 150)
    } else {
        // this part runs if the A button is *not* pressed
        basic.showNumber(0, 150)
    }
})
```
