# Intro to CS

## A 14 week Introduction to Computer Science course.

This course is targeted to middle school grades 6-8 (ages 11-14 years).  It is also written for teachers who may not have a Computer Science background, or who may be teaching an "Intro to Computer Science" course for the first time.

This course takes approximately 14 weeks to complete, spending about 1 week on each of the first 11 lessons, and 3 weeks for students to complete the final project at the end.  Of course, teachers should feel free to customize the curriculum to meet individual school or district resources and timeframe.
